Diploma Thesis on Unity + GitHub

Project: Intuitive Cross-Platform Game Constructor

Description:
This project is the result of my Bachelor thesis, focusing on the development of an intuitive cross-platform game constructor aimed at creating pixel-based games for single players. The goal of this tool is to provide both novice and experienced users with an easy-to-use platform for designing simple games without the need for advanced programming skills.

The game constructor allows users to drag and drop various game elements, customize characters, and set up game mechanics through an interactive interface. With cross-platform compatibility, it ensures users can work on different devices and operating systems seamlessly.

Languages: C++, C#
Tools: Unity (for game development), GitHub (for version control)
Other: SQL (for database management), various design tools for interface creation

Feel free to explore the repository, contribute, or try out the game constructor yourself!
