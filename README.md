Project: Intuitive Cross-Platform Game Constructor
Description:
This project is my Bachelor thesis, which focuses on the development of an intuitive cross-platform game constructor designed for creating pixel-based games for single players. The goal of this project was to create an easy-to-use tool that allows both novice and experienced users to design simple games without requiring advanced programming knowledge.

The game constructor allows users to drag and drop various game elements, customize characters, and set up game mechanics, providing an interactive and engaging interface for game creation. The platform is cross-platform, ensuring compatibility across different devices and operating systems.

Key Features:
Cross-Platform: The tool works on multiple platforms, making it accessible to a wide range of users.
User-Friendly Interface: The game builder has a simple, intuitive design that minimizes the learning curve for users.
Customizable Pixel Art: Users can create pixel-based characters and environments with ease.
Game Logic Automation: The constructor automatically manages various game development processes, reducing the manual effort required.
Testing and Debugging: Built-in features to test and debug the game as it is being created.

Technologies Used:
Languages: C++, C#
Tools: Unity (for game development), GitHub (for version control)
Other: SQL (for database management), various design tools for interface creation
Feel free to explore the project and try the game constructor yourself!
